                    SPARKRJ is an Atlanta based nonprofit that focuses on informing and educating women and people in the LGBTQ+ community on their rights and the pressing issues that they face. As a team of all women, we felt a personal connection to the topic of reproductive rights. We spent the next four weeks breaking down and rebuilding the website from scratch to provide a user experience that is both comforting and easy to navigate.

We have observed that the website isn't clear on it's purpose, which is causing these individuals to not have the necessary information they need to move forward.</p>

                        - Are you familiar with your reproductive rights in the state of Georgia?
                        - Do you know where to go to get information on fertility?</h3>
                      <p>Due to the the subject of fertility and reproductive rights, we decided to go with a survey instead of personal interviews to offer comfort and anonymity to the users. We created the surveys in order to get a better understanding of the problem. The survey was taken by 15 individuals ages ranging from 17 to 53, The responses were collected in the form of short answer and multiple choice and then out into a graph to get more insights at an early stage</p>

She needs to join a group of like minded individuals to help raise awareness and educate female reproductive rights because she is trying to take all the necessary measures needed to stay aware of all the issues that she may need to communicate within her intimate relationship.</p>

                      <p>Card sorting played a vital role in our ideation phase. The problem defined was centered around the lack of organization in the top navigation bar and incorrect placement of secondary tabs. The original SparkRJ webpage was flooded with unnessesary secondary and tertiary tabs, proving very difficult for the user to reach their goal. The card sorting process allowed my team to completely break down and build back up the navigation in a way that offers clarity to the user. </p>
